# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Macine-Learning

![Titanic](titanic.jpg)

## Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using a dataset containing various passenger attributes such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare. The project utilizes two popular algorithms, Linear Regression and Random Forest, to build predictive models and determine factors influencing passenger survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It consists of two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`, containing training and testing data, respectively.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `src/`: Python source code for model training and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required packages for reproducing the environment.

## Usage

To replicate the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ItzGhost33/Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Macine-Learning.git`
2. Install the required packages using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data analysis and model development.
4. Use the Python scripts in the `src/` directory to train and evaluate your models.
5. Visualize and interpret the results.

## Results

The project achieved impressive results in predicting passenger survival. Key findings and insights from the models are presented in the Jupyter notebooks and can be further explored in the project documentation.
